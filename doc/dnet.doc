	DNET [debug] [-m0]

NEW Nov 89:  DNet for both UNIX and AMIGA sides default to 7 bit packet
	     mode.  If you are running on an 8 bit network use the
	     -m0 option to defeat 6 bit encoding used to send binary on
	     a 7 bit network.

	Run the DNET protocol on descriptor 0.  If the enviroment variable
	DNETDIR exists, DNET will create the rendezvous sockets in the
	specified directory (DNETDIR must have a hanging slash on it),
	otherwise the current directory is used.

	DNET also opens a log file (DNET.LOG) in the directory.  If the debug
	option is given, DNET writes gobs of debugging information to the log.

	Descriptor 0 may be a tty or socket.

	To allow DNET to startup servers on demand, the file "dnet.servers"
	must exist in the rendezvous directory.

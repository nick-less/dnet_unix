UNIX/DRAW


DRAW [port#]

	(default: 8195 = AMIGTERM (talk window))

	Connect to the remote port and place the TTY in RAW mode.  The
	connection can only be terminated by the remote end, or by killing
	the process on the UNIX end.

	The default port brings up a 'talk' window on the Amiga.  AMIGATERM
	will recognize a ^C sent from DRAW and close the connection.

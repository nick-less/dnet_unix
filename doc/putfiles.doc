UNIX/PUTFILES
AMIGA/PUTFILES

	PUTFILES [-dDESTDIR] file/dir file/dir file/dir ..

	File transfer client.  Transfer the specified files and or directories
	to the destination directory on the remote machine.  For instance:

	unix:  putfiles -dram: charlie.txt /usr/include

	*places the file charlie.txt as ram:charlie.txt, and places the 
	 directory structure /usr/include as ram:include/(whatever).

	The default destination directory depends on the remote host.  If the
	destination is an Amiga, the default is DF0: (so you probably always
	want to specify a -d switch).  On the UNIX end, the default is whatever
	is set in the file dnet.servers

	Currently, no file compression is done.  I also hope to add 
	semi-automatic crash recovery (continue download where you left off
	after a crash), though it should be noted that it is very difficult
	to crash DNET with random modem noise.

UNIX/DSOC


DSOC [port#]

	(default: 8196 = AMIGSHELL (CLI window))

	Connect to the remote port but keep the TTY in COOKED mode (normal).
	The connection will be terminated by killing the process on the UNIX
	end or typing ^C.  NOTE THAT ^C KILLS DSOC AND IS NOT SENT THROUGH TO
	THE REMOTE CLI.

	The default port accesses the SCLI server on the Amiga end, which
	starts up a CLI.  Things work properly only if *MY* PIPE: device is
	installed on the Amiga.  Things close down properly only if you
	have a CLI prompt when you exit DSOC.

	The SCLI server currently handles only one connection at a time.
